# Internship-selection-Project
For my internship selection process project, I developed a responsive and interactive web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consisted of the development of a simulation for an interstate freight transport system.

The program consists of 2 different functionalities:

1. The first functionality allows the user to indicate the name of two cities and the mode of transport: the program should show the road distance between them and the total cost calculated for the stretch. (A .csv document which contained a multidimensional array that represents the distances between the cities was converted into a JSON object for further parsing).

2. The second functionality allows the user to list a sequence of cities and add a list of items to be transported and their weights. The program also calculates the total distance to be traveled and identifies the most suitable truck model for this transport, as well as the costs involved. (in development)
